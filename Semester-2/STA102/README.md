## Statistic & Probability Solver App

- [Web App](https://stat.ahjim.com)

An app created by me, includes almost every calculation I have learned.

**_Note:_** There is no scatter plot yet, skewness explanation is textual not visual yet, Standard Normal distribution is not calculating all values, rather it's pulling data from the Standard Normal Chart (value range is [-3, 3]).
