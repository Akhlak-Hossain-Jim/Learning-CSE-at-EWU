1. Determine the correlation coefficient from randomly selected sample observations and interpret the relationship between x and y. [2+1]

   | x:  | 4   | 5   | 3   | 6   | 10  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | y:  | 4   | 6   | 5   | 7   | 7   |

2. A recent article in Business Week listed the “Best Small Companies.” We are interested in the companies’ sales and earnings results. A random sample of 8 companies was selected, and the sales and earnings, in millions of dollars, are reported below.

   | Sales ($million)    | 89.2 | 18.6 | 18.2 | 71.7 | 58.6 | 46.8 | 17.5 | 11.9 |
   | ------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
   | Earnings ($million) | 4.9  | 4.4  | 1.3  | 8    | 6.6  | 4.1  | 2.6  | 1.7  |

   Let sales be the independent variable and earnings be the dependent variable.

   (i) Determine the estimated regression equation and comment on the coefficient of X. [2+1]

   (ii) For a small company with $50.0 million in sales, estimate the earnings. [1]

   (iii) Calculate the standard error of estimate and comment on it. [2+1]

   (iv) Find the coefficient of determination and interpret the result. [2+1]
