# Assignment 6

1. Nine percent of undergraduate students carry credit card balances greater than $7000 (Reader’s Digest, July 2002). Suppose 10 undergraduate students are selected randomly to be interviewed about credit card usage.

   - a. Is the selection of 10 students a binomial experiment? Explain.
   - b. Find the probability that two of the students will have a credit card balance more than $7000.
   - c. What is the probability that none will have a credit card balance greater than $7000?
   - d. What is the probability that at least three will have a credit card balance greater than $7000?

2. Military radar and missile detection systems are designed to warn a country of an enemy attack. A reliability question is whether a detection system will be able to identify an attack and issue a warning. Assume that a particular detection system has a 0.90 probability of detecting a missile attack. Use the binomial probability distribution to answer the following questions.
   - a. What is the probability that a single detection system will detect an attack?
   - b. If two detection systems are installed in the same area and operate independently, what is the probability that at least one of the systems will detect the attack?
   - c. If three systems are installed, what is the probability that at least one of the systems will detect the attack?
   - d. Would you recommend that multiple detection systems be used? Explain.
3. Fifty percent of Americans believed the country was in a recession, even though technically the economy had not shown two straight quarters of negative growth (BusinessWeek, July 30, 2001). For a sample of 20 Americans, make the following calculations.
   - a. Compute the probability that exactly 12 people believed the country was in a recession.
   - b. Compute the probability that no more than one people believed the country was in a recession.
   - c. How many people would you expect to say the country was in a recession?
   - d. Compute the variance and standard deviation of the number of people who believed the country was in a recession.
4. Airline passengers arrive randomly and independently at the passenger-screening facility at a major international airport. The mean arrival rate is 10 passengers per minute.
   - a. Compute the probability of no arrivals in a one-minute period.
   - b. Compute the probability that three or fewer passengers arrive in a one-minute period.
   - c. Compute the probability of no arrivals in a 30-second period.
   - d. Compute the probability of at least one arrival in a 15-second period.
5. An average of 15 aircraft accidents occur each year (The World Almanac and Book of Facts).

   - a. Compute the mean number of aircraft accidents per month.
   - b. Compute the probability of no accidents during a month.
   - c. Compute the probability of exactly one accident during a month.
   - d. Compute the probability of more than one accident during a month.

6. The National Safety Council (NSC) estimates that off-the-job accidents cost U.S. businesses almost $200 billion annually in lost productivity (National Safety Council, March 2006). Based on NSC estimates, companies with 50 employees are expected to average three employee off- the-job accidents per year. Answer the following questions for companies with 50 employees.
   - a. What is the probability of no off-the-job accidents during a one-year period?
   - b. What is the probability of at least two off-the-job accidents during a one-year period?
   - c. What is the expected number of off-the-job accidents during six months?
   - d. What is the probability of no off-the-job accidents during the next six months?
7. For borrowers with good credit scores, the mean debt for revolving and installment accounts is $15,015 (BusinessWeek, March 20, 2006). Assume the standard deviation is $3540 and that debt amounts are normally distributed.
   - a. What is the probability that the debt for a borrower with good credit is more than $18,000?
   - b. What is the probability that the debt for a borrower with good credit is less than $10,000?
   - c. What is the probability that the debt for a borrower with good credit is between $12,000 and
     $18,000?
   - d. What is the probability that the debt for a borrower with good credit is no more than $14,000?
8. The average stock price for companies making up the S&P 500 is $30, and the standard deviation is $8.20 (BusinessWeek, Special Annual Issue, Spring 2003). Assume the stock prices are normally distributed.
   - a. What is the probability a company will have a stock price of at least $40?
   - b. What is the probability a company will have a stock price no higher than $20?
   - c. How high does a stock price have to be to put a company in the top 10%?
9. In an article about the cost of health care, Money magazine reported that a visit to a hospital emergency room for something as simple as a sore throat has a mean cost of $328 (Money, January 2009). Assume that the cost for this type of hospital emergency room visit is normally distributed with a standard deviation of $92. Answer the following questions about the cost of a hospital emergency room visit for this medical service.
   - a. What is the probability that the cost will be more than $500?
   - b. What is the probability that the cost will be less than $250?
   - c. What is the probability that the cost will be between $300 and $400?
   - d. If the cost to a patient is in the lower 8% of charges for this medical service, what was the cost
     of this patient’s emergency room visit?
