1. Suppose that A and B are mutually exclusive events for which P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.5. What is the probability that

   (a) Either A or B occurs?

   (b) A occurs but B does not?

   (c) Both A and B occur?

2. The probability that a regularly scheduled flight departs on time is P(D) = 0.83; the probability that it arrives on time is P(A) = 0.82; and the probability that it departs and arrives on time is P(D âˆ© A) = 0.78. Find the probability that a plane

   (a) Arrives on time given that it departed on time, and

   (b) Departed on time given that it has arrived on time.

3. Suppose that we have a fuse box containing 20 fuses, of which 5 are defective. If 2 fuses are selected at random and removed from the box in succession without replacing the first, what is the probability that both fuses are defective?

4. A random sample of 200 adults is classified below by sex and their level of education attained.

   | Education  | Male | Female |
   | ---------- | ---- | ------ |
   | Elementary | 38   | 45     |
   | Secondary  | 28   | 50     |
   | College "  | 22   | 17     |

   If a person is picked at random from this group, find the probability that

   (a) The person is a male, given that the person has a secondary education;

   (b) The person does not have a college degree, given that the person is a female.
