## Questions
### Page 14 (Excercise 1.1)

- (11) Let p and q be the propositions “Swimming at the New Jersey shore is allowed” and “Sharks have been spotted near the shore,” respectively. Express each of these compound propositions as an English sentence.
  - d) p → ¬q
  - e) ¬q → p
- <pre>
  (15) Let p and q be the propositions
        p: You drive over 65 miles per hour.
        q: You get a speeding ticket.
      Write these propositions using p and q and logical connectives (including negations).
  </pre>
  - d) If you do not drive over 65 miles per hour, then you will not get a speeding ticket.
  - e) Driving over 65 miles per hour is sufficient for getting a speeding ticket.
  - f) You get a speeding ticket, but you do not drive over 65 miles per hour.
- (33) Construct a truth table for each of these compound propositions.
  - f) (p → q) → (q → p)

### Page 38 (Excercise 1.3)

- (12) Show that each of these conditional statements is a tautology by using truth tables.
  - b) [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] → (p → r)
  - c) [p ∧ (p → q)] → q
- (26) Show that (p → q) ∧ (p → r) and p → (q ∧ r) are logically equivalent.
- (27) Show that (p → r) ∧ (q → r) and (p ∨ q) → r are logically equivalent
