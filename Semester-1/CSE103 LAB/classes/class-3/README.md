Practice Problems:

1. Write a C program to check whether the `triangle` is `equilateral`, `isosceles` or `scalene` triangle.
2. Write a C program to input all `sides` of a triangle and checks whether `triangle is valid or not`.
3. Write a C program to input `angles` of a `triangle` and checks whether `triangle is valid or not`.
4. Write a C program to `find maximum between three numbers`.
5. Write a C program which takes an integer as user input that indicates the `annual salary` of a person. The program should find and display the `monthly salary` of that person.
6. Write a C program to check whether a `year` is a `leap year or not`.
7. Write a C program to input `basic salary` of an employee and calculate its `Gross salary` according to following:
   - `Basic Salary &lt;= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80%`
   - `Basic Salary &lt;= 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90%`
   - `Basic Salary &gt; 20000 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%`
8. Write a C program to input a number indicating `income of a person` and `calculate tax` with the given following conditions.
   - `if income is less then, 1,50,000 then no tax`
   - `if taxable income is in the range 1,50,001-300,000 then charge 10% tax`
   - `if taxable income is in the range 3,00,001-500,000 then charge 20% tax`
   - `if taxable income is above 5,00,001 then charge 30% tax.`
9. Write a C program which can input `two numbers` indicating a point in a `2D co-ordinate` and determine its `quadrant`.
