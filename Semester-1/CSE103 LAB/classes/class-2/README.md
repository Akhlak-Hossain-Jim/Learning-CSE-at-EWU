sir have shown us how to write and run a c program and give us following problems to solve.

Practice Problem

1. Write a program to input a `number` and calculate its `square` and `cube`.
2. Write a program to input the `length` and `breadth` of a rectangle and calculate its `area`. `Area=Length*Breadth`.
3. Write a program to input the `radius` and calculate the `area of the circle` and `circumference of a circle`. `Area of circle = 3.14*r*r`, `Circumference of circle = 2*3.14*r`.
4. Write a program to input the `radius` and `height` of a cylinder and calculate the volume of the cylinder. `Volume=3.14*r*r*h`.
5. Write a program to input `principal`, `rate` and `time` and `calculate` Simple Interest. `SimpleInterest=Principal*Rate*Time/100`.
6. Write a program to convert temperature from `Celsius` to `Fahrenheit`. `F=C*9/5+32`.
7. Write a program to Input `distance (in km)` and convert it into `meters`, `feet`, `inches`, and `centimeters`.
8. Write a program to Input `minutes` and convert into `hours` and `minutes`. `(ie: input 55(minutes) :: output: 0hour and 55minutes)`
9. Write a program to Input 5 subject marks of a student and find total marks and percentage obtained by the student.
10. Write a program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. `C=(F-32)*5/9`
11. Write a program to input total number of days and convert it into years, months, weeks, and days.
12. Write a C program which can input an integer number indicating length (in centimeter scale) of a book and display length of that book in inch scale. `[1 inch = 2.54 centimeter]`
13. Suppose you have two water containers â€“ one is sphere shaped and another is cubic shaped. Write a C program which can `input two integers indicating radius of a sphere-shaped container and length of each side of the cubic shaped container`. Display `volume` of each object.
14. Write a C program which can `input running time of a movie` by `inputting two numbers mentioning hour and minute` of that movie. Display what is `the running time` of that movie in `minutes`. Display running time in `fractional hour format`. As example, `if input is 1 hour 15 minutes` then `one output is 75 minutes` and another `output is 1.25 hours`.
15. Write a C program which can `input 4 integer numbers` from the users and `display the ratio between differences of first two numbers` and `last two numbers`. As example, `if input values are A, B, C, and D` then find `(A-B)/(C-D)`.
16. Write a C program which can `input four integer numbers` that indicated `2 points in a 2D co-ordinate system`. Display the distance between those two points. Like we do in Maths `A(2, 3)`, `B(4, 2)` and distance is $\sqrt(y2-y1)^2 + (x2-x1)^2$
17. Write a C program which can input length of `three sides` of `a triangle` and display `the area of the triangle`.
