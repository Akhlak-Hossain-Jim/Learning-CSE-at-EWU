Practice Problems:

1. Write a C program which can input a character and display whether it is an uppercase letter, lowercase letter or digit.
2. Write a C program which can input three lower case letters and display whether any duplicate exists or not.
3. Write a C program which can input some letters and display ratio between uppercase and lowercase letters.
4. Write a C program which can input some letters into an array and change each uppercase letter to its next uppercase letter keeping lowercase letter unchanged.
5. Write a C program which can input some letters and display how many uppercase vowels and how many lowercase vowels exist.
6. Write a C program which can input some letters and interchange each one case.
7. Write a C program which can input some lowercase letters and display which vowels appear most.
8. Input a number and display summation of all factors of that number. Calculating summation of factors should be done in a function.

```txt
Sample Input: 10
Sample Output: 18
Possible function looks like:
Int FactorSum(int p){
-----
-----
-----
}
```

9. Input two numbers and display how many common factors are available in those two numbers.

```txt
Calculating the number of common factors should be done in a function.

Sample Input: 10 15
Sample Output: 2
Possible function looks like:
Int CommonFactor(int p, int q){
-----
-----
-----
}
```

10. Input some numbers and display the maximum number of that array. Calculating the maximum should be done in a function.

```txt
Sample Input: 5
12 15 11 22 14
Sample Output: 22
Possible function looks like:
Int FindMax(int *p, int n){
-----
-----
-----
}
```

11. Input a word and display the ratio between vowels and consonants of that word using a function.

```txt
Sample Input: Apple
Sample Output: 0.666667

Possible function looks like:
flloat Ratio(char *p){
-----
-----
-----
}
```

12. Input a word and display number of uppercase letters in that word using a function.

```txt
Sample Input: Apple
Sample Output: 1
Possible function looks like:
Int CountUpper(char *p){
-----
-----
-----
}
```
