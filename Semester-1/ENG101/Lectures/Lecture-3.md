### Narrative Paragraph

**Page no 44**

In the paragraph we have to start with the Outline of the Paragraph.

#### Topic Sentence

Then,

Details 1: (ie) Environment

- some point
- some point
- some point

Details 2: (ie) Food

- some point
- some point
- some point

Details 3: (ie) View

- some point
- some point
- some point

> Then, paragraph....

The paragraph has to start with the same sentence as topic sentence. Then have to describe the pointers and sub-pointers described in the outline in sequence and have to connect the pointers with connectors (ie; firstly, secondly, finally).

> The pointers (Details) need to be at least 3 and sub-pointers can be 2-3, and at least 120 words.

> The difference between Narrative Paragraph and Descriptive paragraph is: We write `Descriptive paragraph` as an third person or observer but in `Narrative paragraph` we should write it as a first person, means It should be in our own opinion and our own feeling and will be in `past tense`.

---

> Then we wrote a paragraph on the `My first day at East West University` and mam gave us correction on the writings we have done. And for assignment purpose we should create a draft based on the correction mam gave.

> **There will be a class test in next Wednesday (19 October 2022) on the Academic word List 1 (page: 60 to 69)**
