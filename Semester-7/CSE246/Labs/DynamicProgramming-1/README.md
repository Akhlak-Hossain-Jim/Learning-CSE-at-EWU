## 1. 0-1 Knapsack

You are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. Your task is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items to fit into the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

**Sample Input:**

```shell
4
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
8
```

**Sample Output:**

```shell
10
Selected Items (1-based index): [2, 4]
```
