# Divide and Conquer Algorithms

## 1. Binary Search

Given a sorted array of n integers and a target value, determine if the target exists in the array in logarithmic time using the binary search algorithm. If the target exists in the array, print the index of it.

**Sample Input and Output**

```shell
Data: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
Target: 7

Found at index: 3
```

```shell
Data: 6, 7, 12
Target: 15

Not Found
```

## 2. Merge Sort

Given an integer array, sort it using the merge sort algorithm.

**Sample Input and Output**

```shell
Data: 2, 3, 7, 5
Output: 2, 3, 5, 7
```

```shell
Data: 12, 6, 7
Output: 6, 7, 12
```

## 3. Quick Sort

Given an integer array, sort it using the quick sort algorithm.

**Sample Input and Output**

```shell
Data: 2, 3, 7, 5
Output: 2, 3, 5, 7
```

```shell
Data: 12, 6, 7
Output: 6, 7, 12
```

## 4. Closest Pair of Points

We are given an array of n points in the plane, and the problem is to find out the closest pair of points in the array.

**Sample Input and Output**

```shell
Input: {2, 3}, {12, 30}, {40, 50}, {5, 1}, {12, 10}, {3, 4}
Output: The smallest distance is 1.41421
```
