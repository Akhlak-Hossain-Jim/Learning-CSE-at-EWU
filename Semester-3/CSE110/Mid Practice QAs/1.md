# Problem sets

**1. Employee Program**

This program simulates an employee management system with the following features:

- Create employees
- Update employee information
- Delete employees
- Calculate employee salaries

The program uses **inheritance** to create two classes: `Employee` and `Manager`. The `Employee` class is the superclass, and the `Manager` class is the subclass. The `Manager` class inherits all the features of the `Employee` class, but it also has a unique feature: it can manage other employees.

The program also uses **polymorphism** to allow the user to interact with employees in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `calculateSalary()` method on any employee, regardless of whether it is an `Employee` or a `Manager`. The `calculateSalary()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

**Input:**

```
Create Employee
Name: John Doe
Job Title: Software Engineer
Salary: 100000

Create Manager
Name: Jane Doe
Job Title: Manager
Salary: 150000

Update Employee Salary
Name: John Doe
New Salary: 120000

Delete Employee
Name: Jane Doe

```

**Output:**

```
Employees:

John Doe - Software Engineer - Salary: 120000

Managers:

None

```

**Explanation:**

The program creates two employees: John Doe, a software engineer, and Jane Doe, a manager. The user then updates John Doe's salary to $120,000 and deletes Jane Doe. The program then prints out a list of the remaining employees.

The `Employee` class has the following variables:

- `name` - The name of the employee
- `jobTitle` - The job title of the employee
- `salary` - The salary of the employee

The `Employee` class has the following methods:

- `calculateSalary()` - Calculates the salary of the employee

The `Manager` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Employee` class. The `Manager` class also has the following variable:

- `numberOfEmployees` - The number of employees managed by the manager

The `Manager` class has the following method:

- `manageEmployees()` - manages the employees of the manager

The `calculateSalary()` method is implemented differently in the `Manager` class than in the `Employee` class. This is because the `Manager` class needs to take into account the number of employees managed when calculating the salary.

The `manageEmployees()` method is only implemented in the `Manager` class. This method manages the employees of the manager.

The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with employees in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `calculateSalary()` method on any employee, regardless of whether it is an `Employee` or a `Manager`. The `calculateSalary()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

Sure, here are 20 programs to practice class relation (association, inheritance), polymorphism and abstract class in Java with medium & hard level of complexity. The programs include sample input and output, as well as creative explanations about the variables, methods, which class should have with which class and what type of relationship (association and/or inheritance), where to use polymorphism and abstraction class/method.

**2. Bank Account Program**

This program simulates a bank account with the following features:

- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check balance
- Transfer money to another account

The program uses **inheritance** to create two classes: `BankAccount` and `SavingsAccount`. The `BankAccount` class is the superclass, and the `SavingsAccount` class is the subclass. The `SavingsAccount` class inherits all the features of the `BankAccount` class, but it also has a unique feature: it allows the user to earn interest on their balance.

The program also uses **polymorphism** to allow the user to interact with the bank accounts in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `deposit()` method on any bank account, regardless of whether it is a `BankAccount` or a `SavingsAccount`. The `deposit()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

**Input:**

```
Account Number: 123456789
Account Type: Saving
Initial Balance: 1000

Transaction: Deposit
Amount: 500

Transaction: Withdraw
Amount: 200

Transaction: Transfer
Account Number: 987654321
Amount: 300
```

**Output:**

```
Current Balance: 900
Interest Earned: 0
```

**Explanation:**

The program creates two bank accounts: a `BankAccount` with account number 123456789 and a `SavingsAccount` with account number 987654321. The user then deposits $500 into the savings account and withdraws $200 from the savings account. The user then transfers $300 from the savings account to the checking account. The program then prints out the current balance of the savings account, which is $900. The program also prints out the interest earned on the savings account, which is $0.

The `BankAccount` class has the following variables:

- `accountNumber` - The account number
- `balance` - The balance

The `BankAccount` class has the following methods:

- `deposit()` - Deposits money into the account
- `withdraw()` - Withdraws money from the account
- `checkBalance()` - Checks the balance of the account
- `transfer()` - Transfers money to another account

The `SavingsAccount` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `BankAccount` class. The `SavingsAccount` class also has the following variable:

- `interestRate` - The interest rate

The `SavingsAccount` class has the following method:

- `calculateInterest()` - Calculates the interest earned on the account

The `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `checkBalance()`, and `transfer()` methods are all implemented differently in the `SavingsAccount` class than in the `BankAccount` class. This is because the `SavingsAccount` class needs to take into account the interest rate when calculating the balance of the account.

The `calculateInterest()` method is only implemented in the `SavingsAccount` class. This method calculates the interest earned on the account based on the balance and the interest rate.

The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with the bank accounts in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `deposit()` method on any bank account, regardless of whether it is a `BankAccount` or a `SavingsAccount`. The `deposit()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

Sure, here is another program:

**3. Book Store Program**

This program simulates a book store with the following features:

- Add books
- Sell books
- Search for books
- Track inventory

The program uses **inheritance** to create two classes: `Book` and `ReferenceBook`. The `Book` class is the superclass, and the `ReferenceBook` class is the subclass. The `ReferenceBook` class inherits all the features of the `Book` class, but it also has a unique feature: it is not for sale.

The program also uses **polymorphism** to allow the user to interact with books in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `sell()` method on any book, regardless of whether it is a `Book` or a `ReferenceBook`. The `sell()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

**Input:**

```
Add Book
Title: The Lord of the Rings
Author: J.R.R. Tolkien
Price: 20

Add ReferenceBook
Title: The Elements of Style
Author: William Strunk Jr.
Price: 10

Sell Book
Title: The Lord of the Rings

Search for Book
Title: The Elements of Style
```

**Output:**

```
Books in stock:

The Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkien - Price: 20

Reference Books in stock:

The Elements of Style - William Strunk Jr. - Price: 10

Sold Books:

The Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkien - Price: 20
```

**Explanation:**

The program adds two books to the store: The Lord of the Rings and The Elements of Style. The user then sells The Lord of the Rings. The program then searches for The Elements of Style and prints out the book information.

The `Book` class has the following variables:

- `title` - The title of the book
- `author` - The author of the book
- `price` - The price of the book

The `Book` class has the following methods:

- `sell()` - Sells the book

The `ReferenceBook` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Book` class. The `ReferenceBook` class also has the following variable:

- `forSale` - A boolean value indicating whether the book is for sale

The `ReferenceBook` class has the following method:

- `isForSale()` - Returns the value of the `forSale` variable

The `sell()` method is implemented differently in the `ReferenceBook` class than in the `Book` class. This is because the `ReferenceBook` class is not for sale.

The `isForSale()` method is only implemented in the `ReferenceBook` class. This method returns the value of the `forSale` variable.

The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with books in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `sell()` method on any book, regardless of whether it is a `Book` or a `ReferenceBook`. The `sell()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

I hope these examples are helpful!
