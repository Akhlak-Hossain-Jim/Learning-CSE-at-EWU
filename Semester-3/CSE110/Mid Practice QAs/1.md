# Problem sets

1. **Employee Program**

   This program simulates an employee management system with the following features:

   - Create employees
   - Update employee information
   - Delete employees
   - Calculate employee salaries

   The program uses **inheritance** to create two classes: `Employee` and `Manager`. The `Employee` class is the superclass, and the `Manager` class is the subclass. The `Manager` class inherits all the features of the `Employee` class, but it also has a unique feature: it can manage other employees.

   The program also uses **polymorphism** to allow the user to interact with employees in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `calculateSalary()` method on any employee, regardless of whether it is an `Employee` or a `Manager`. The `calculateSalary()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

   **Input:**

   ```md
   Create Employee
   Name: John Doe
   Job Title: Software Engineer
   Salary: 100000

   Create Manager
   Name: Jane Doe
   Job Title: Manager
   Salary: 150000

   Update Employee Salary
   Name: John Doe
   New Salary: 120000

   Delete Employee
   Name: Jane Doe
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```md
   Employees:

   John Doe - Software Engineer - Salary: 120000

   Managers:

   None
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   The program creates two employees: John Doe, a software engineer, and Jane Doe, a manager. The user then updates John Doe's salary to $120,000 and deletes Jane Doe. The program then prints out a list of the remaining employees.

   The `Employee` class has the following variables:

   - `name` - The name of the employee
   - `jobTitle` - The job title of the employee
   - `salary` - The salary of the employee

   The `Employee` class has the following methods:

   - `calculateSalary()` - Calculates the salary of the employee

   The `Manager` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Employee` class. The `Manager` class also has the following variable:

   - `numberOfEmployees` - The number of employees managed by the manager

   The `Manager` class has the following method:

   - `manageEmployees()` - manages the employees of the manager

   The `calculateSalary()` method is implemented differently in the `Manager` class than in the `Employee` class. This is because the `Manager` class needs to take into account the number of employees managed when calculating the salary.

   The `manageEmployees()` method is only implemented in the `Manager` class. This method manages the employees of the manager.

   The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with employees in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `calculateSalary()` method on any employee, regardless of whether it is an `Employee` or a `Manager`. The `calculateSalary()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

   Sure, here are 20 programs to practice class relation (association, inheritance), polymorphism and abstract class in Java with medium & hard level of complexity. The programs include sample input and output, as well as creative explanations about the variables, methods, which class should have with which class and what type of relationship (association and/or inheritance), where to use polymorphism and abstraction class/method.

2. **Bank Account Program**

   This program simulates a bank account with the following features:

   - Deposit money
   - Withdraw money
   - Check balance
   - Transfer money to another account

   The program uses **inheritance** to create two classes: `BankAccount` and `SavingsAccount`. The `BankAccount` class is the superclass, and the `SavingsAccount` class is the subclass. The `SavingsAccount` class inherits all the features of the `BankAccount` class, but it also has a unique feature: it allows the user to earn interest on their balance.

   The program also uses **polymorphism** to allow the user to interact with the bank accounts in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `deposit()` method on any bank account, regardless of whether it is a `BankAccount` or a `SavingsAccount`. The `deposit()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

   **Input:**

   ```md
   Account Number: 123456789
   Account Type: Saving
   Initial Balance: 1000

   Transaction: Deposit
   Amount: 500

   Transaction: Withdraw
   Amount: 200

   Transaction: Transfer
   Account Number: 987654321
   Amount: 300
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```md
   Current Balance: 900
   Interest Earned: 0
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   The program creates two bank accounts: a `BankAccount` with account number 123456789 and a `SavingsAccount` with account number 987654321. The user then deposits $500 into the savings account and withdraws $200 from the savings account. The user then transfers $300 from the savings account to the checking account. The program then prints out the current balance of the savings account, which is $900. The program also prints out the interest earned on the savings account, which is $0.

   The `BankAccount` class has the following variables:

   - `accountNumber` - The account number
   - `balance` - The balance

   The `BankAccount` class has the following methods:

   - `deposit()` - Deposits money into the account
   - `withdraw()` - Withdraws money from the account
   - `checkBalance()` - Checks the balance of the account
   - `transfer()` - Transfers money to another account

   The `SavingsAccount` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `BankAccount` class. The `SavingsAccount` class also has the following variable:

   - `interestRate` - The interest rate

   The `SavingsAccount` class has the following method:

   - `calculateInterest()` - Calculates the interest earned on the account

   The `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `checkBalance()`, and `transfer()` methods are all implemented differently in the `SavingsAccount` class than in the `BankAccount` class. This is because the `SavingsAccount` class needs to take into account the interest rate when calculating the balance of the account.

   The `calculateInterest()` method is only implemented in the `SavingsAccount` class. This method calculates the interest earned on the account based on the balance and the interest rate.

   The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with the bank accounts in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `deposit()` method on any bank account, regardless of whether it is a `BankAccount` or a `SavingsAccount`. The `deposit()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

3. **Book Store Program**

   This program simulates a book store with the following features:

   - Add books
   - Sell books
   - Search for books
   - Track inventory

   The program uses **inheritance** to create two classes: `Book` and `ReferenceBook`. The `Book` class is the superclass, and the `ReferenceBook` class is the subclass. The `ReferenceBook` class inherits all the features of the `Book` class, but it also has a unique feature: it is not for sale.

   The program also uses **polymorphism** to allow the user to interact with books in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `sell()` method on any book, regardless of whether it is a `Book` or a `ReferenceBook`. The `sell()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

   **Input:**

   ```md
   Add Book
   Title: The Lord of the Rings
   Author: J.R.R. Tolkien
   Price: 20

   Add ReferenceBook
   Title: The Elements of Style
   Author: William Strunk Jr.
   Price: 10

   Sell Book
   Title: The Lord of the Rings

   Search for Book
   Title: The Elements of Style
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```md
   Books in stock:

   The Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkien - Price: 20

   Reference Books in stock:

   The Elements of Style - William Strunk Jr. - Price: 10

   Sold Books:

   The Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkien - Price: 20
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   The program adds two books to the store: The Lord of the Rings and The Elements of Style. The user then sells The Lord of the Rings. The program then searches for The Elements of Style and prints out the book information.

   The `Book` class has the following variables:

   - `title` - The title of the book
   - `author` - The author of the book
   - `price` - The price of the book

   The `Book` class has the following methods:

   - `sell()` - Sells the book

   The `ReferenceBook` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Book` class. The `ReferenceBook` class also has the following variable:

   - `forSale` - A boolean value indicating whether the book is for sale

   The `ReferenceBook` class has the following method:

   - `isForSale()` - Returns the value of the `forSale` variable

   The `sell()` method is implemented differently in the `ReferenceBook` class than in the `Book` class. This is because the `ReferenceBook` class is not for sale.

   The `isForSale()` method is only implemented in the `ReferenceBook` class. This method returns the value of the `forSale` variable.

   The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with books in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `sell()` method on any book, regardless of whether it is a `Book` or a `ReferenceBook`. The `sell()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

4. **Animal Shelter Program**

   This program simulates an animal shelter with the following features:

   - Add animals
   - Adopt animals
   - Find animals
   - Track inventory

   The program uses **inheritance** to create three classes: `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat`. The `Animal` class is the superclass, and the `Dog` and `Cat` classes are the subclasses. The `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit all the features of the `Animal` class, but they also have unique features: dogs can bark and cats can meow.

   The program also uses **polymorphism** to allow the user to interact with animals in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `bark()` method on any animal, regardless of whether it is a `Dog` or a `Cat`. The `bark()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

   **Input:**

   ```md
   Add Animal
   Species: Dog
   Name: Sparky
   Age: 1 year

   Add Cat
   Species: Cat
   Name: Mittens
   Age: 2 years

   Adopt Animal
   Species: Dog
   Name: Sparky

   Find Animal
   Species: Cat
   Name: Mittens
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```md
   Animals in shelter:

   Dog - Sparky - 1 year
   Cat - Mittens - 2 years

   Adopted Animals:

   Dog - Sparky - 1 year
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   The program adds two animals to the shelter: Sparky the dog and Mittens the cat. The user then adopts Sparky the dog. The program then searches for Mittens the cat and prints out the animal information.

   The `Animal` class has the following variables:

   - `species` - The species of the animal
   - `name` - The name of the animal
   - `age` - The age of the animal

   The `Animal` class has the following methods:

   - `bark()` - Barks for dogs
   - `meow()` - Meows for cats

   The `Dog` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Animal` class. The `Dog` class also has the following method:

   - `wagTail()` - Wags its tail

   The `Cat` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Animal` class. The `Cat` class also has the following method:

   - `climbTree()` - Climbs a tree

   The `bark()` method is implemented differently in the `Dog` class than in the `Animal` class. This is because dogs bark differently than animals in general.

   The `meow()` method is implemented differently in the `Cat` class than in the `Animal` class. This is because cats meow differently than animals in general.

   The `wagTail()` method is only implemented in the `Dog` class. This method wags the dog's tail.

   The `climbTree()` method is only implemented in the `Cat` class. This method climbs a tree.

   The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with animals in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `bark()` method on any animal, regardless of whether it is a `Dog` or a `Cat`. The `bark()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

5. **Shape Program**

   This program creates a hierarchy of shapes, including `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square`. The `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square` classes all inherit from the `Shape` class. The `Shape` class has the following variables:

   - `color` - The color of the shape
   - `filled` - Whether the shape is filled

   The `Shape` class has the following methods:

   - `draw()` - Draws the shape

   The `Circle` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Shape` class. The `Circle` class also has the following variable:

   - `radius` - The radius of the circle

   The `Circle` class has the following method:

   - `getArea()` - Calculates the area of the circle

   The `Rectangle` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Shape` class. The `Rectangle` class also has the following variables:

   - `width` - The width of the rectangle
   - `height` - The height of the rectangle

   The `Rectangle` class has the following method:

   - `getArea()` - Calculates the area of the rectangle

   The `Square` class inherits all the variables and methods from the `Rectangle` class. The `Square` class does not have any additional variables or methods.

   The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with shapes in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `draw()` method on any shape, regardless of whether it is a `Circle`, `Rectangle`, or `Square`. The `draw()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

   **Input:**

   ```md
   Create Circle
   Color: Red
   Filled: True
   Radius: 10

   Create Rectangle
   Color: Blue
   Filled: False
   Width: 50
   Height: 100

   Create Square
   Color: Green
   Filled: True
   Side Length: 20

   Draw all shapes
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```md
   Drawing a red circle with radius 10.
   Drawing a blue rectangle with width 50 and height 100.
   Drawing a green square with side length 20.
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   The program creates three shapes: a red circle with radius 10, a blue rectangle with width 50 and height 100, and a green square with side length 20. The program then draws all the shapes.

   The `Shape` class has the following variables:

   - `color` - The color of the shape
   - `filled` - Whether the shape is filled

   The `Shape` class has the following methods:

   - `draw()` - Draws the shape

   The `draw()` method is implemented differently in each subclass. The `Circle` class draws a circle, the `Rectangle` class draws a rectangle, and the `Square` class draws a square.

   The program uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with shapes in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `draw()` method on any shape, regardless of whether it is a `Circle`, `Rectangle`, or `Square`. The `draw()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.

6. **Book Club Program**

   This program simulates a book club with the following features:

   - Add members
   - Assign books
   - Track reading progress
   - Discuss books

   The program uses **association** to create a relationship between the `Member` class and the `Book` class. The `Member` class has a `books` attribute, which is a list of `Book` objects. The `Book` class has a `members` attribute, which is a list of `Member` objects.

   The program also uses **polymorphism** to allow the user to interact with members and books in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `read()` method on any member, regardless of whether they have read the book or not. The `read()` method will be implemented differently for members who have read the book and members who have not read the book.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of association and polymorphism.

   **Input:**

   ```md
   Create Member
   Name: John Doe

   Create Book
   Title: The Lord of the Rings
   Author: J.R.R. Tolkien

   Assign Book to Member
   Member: John Doe
   Book: The Lord of the Rings

   Mark Book as Read
   Member: John Doe
   Book: The Lord of the Rings

   Discuss Book
   Book: The Lord of the Rings
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```md
   Members:

   John Doe

   Books:

   The Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkien - Read

   Books Read by John Doe:

   The Lord of the Rings

   Discussions:

   The Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkien
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   The program creates a member named John Doe and assigns the book The Lord of the Rings to him. The program then marks the book as read and starts a discussion about the book.

   The `Member` class has the following variables:

   - `name` - The name of the member

   The `Member` class has the following methods:

   - `read()` - Marks a book as read
   - `discuss()` - Starts a discussion about a book

   The `Book` class has the following variables:

   - `title` - The title of the book
   - `author` - The author of the book

   The `Book` class has the following methods:

   - `getMembers()` - Returns a list of members who have read the book
   - `getDiscussions()` - Returns a list of discussions about the book

   The `read()` method is implemented differently for members who have read the book and members who have not read the book. Members who have read the book can start a discussion about the book. Members who have not read the book can only mark the book as read.

   The `discuss()` method starts a discussion about the book. The discussion is stored in the `Book` class.

   The program uses association to create a relationship between the `Member` class and the `Book` class. The `Member` class has a `books` attribute, which is a list of `Book` objects. The `Book` class has a `members` attribute, which is a list of `Member` objects. This relationship allows the program to track which members have read which books.

   The program also uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with members and books in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `read()` method on any member, regardless of whether they have read the book or not. The `read()` method will be implemented differently for members who have read the book and members who have not read the book.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of association and polymorphism.

7. **Vehicle Program**

   This program simulates a vehicle rental company with the following features:

   - Add vehicles
   - Rent vehicles
   - Return vehicles
   - Track inventory

   The program uses **abstraction** to create an abstract `Vehicle` class. The `Vehicle` class has the following variables:

   - `make` - The make of the vehicle
   - `model` - The model of the vehicle
   - `year` - The year of the vehicle

   The `Vehicle` class has the following methods:

   - `getMileage()` - Returns the mileage of the vehicle

   The `Vehicle` class is abstract, which means that it cannot be instantiated. The `Vehicle` class is used as a base class for other vehicle classes, such as `Car` and `Truck`.

   The `Car` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class. The `Car` class has the following variables:

   - `numDoors` - The number of doors on the car

   The `Car` class has the following methods:

   - `getGasMileage()` - Returns the gas mileage of the car

   The `Truck` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class. The `Truck` class has the following variables:

   - `bedSize` - The size of the truck bed

   The `Truck` class has the following methods:

   - `getTowingCapacity()` - Returns the towing capacity of the truck

   The program uses abstraction to allow the program to be more flexible. The `Vehicle` class is abstract, which means that it can be extended to create new vehicle types. This allows the program to be adapted to new vehicles as they are introduced.

   The program also uses polymorphism to allow the user to interact with vehicles in a generic way. For example, the user can call the `getMileage()` method on any vehicle, regardless of whether it is a car or a truck. The `getMileage()` method will be implemented differently in each class, but the user does not need to know about this difference.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of abstraction and polymorphism.

8. **Shopping Cart Program**

   This program simulates an online shopping cart with the following features:

   - Add items to cart
   - Remove items from cart
   - Checkout
   - Track orders

   The program uses **composition** to create a relationship between the `Item` class and the `ShoppingCart` class. The `Item` class has the following variables:

   - `name` - The name of the item
   - `price` - The price of the item

   The `Item` class has the following methods:

   - `getQuantity()` - Returns the quantity of the item

   The `ShoppingCart` class has the following variables:

   - `items` - A list of `Item` objects

   The `ShoppingCart` class has the following methods:

   - `addItem()` - Adds an item to the cart
   - `removeItem()` - Removes an item from the cart
   - `checkout()` - Calculates the total price of the items in the cart

   The `Item` class is composed by the `ShoppingCart` class. This means that an `Item` object can only exist within a `ShoppingCart` object. The `Item` class is not a standalone object.

   The program uses composition to allow the program to track the quantity of items in the shopping cart. The `Item` class has a `getQuantity()` method, which returns the quantity of the item. The `ShoppingCart` class has an `addItem()` method, which adds an item to the cart and increments the quantity of the item. The `ShoppingCart` class has a `removeItem()` method, which removes an item from the cart and decrements the quantity of the item.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of composition.

9. **Game Character Program**

   This program simulates a game character with the following features:

   - Create characters
   - Equip items
   - Fight enemies
   - Level up

   The program uses **aggregation** to create a relationship between the `Character` class and the `Item` class. The `Character` class has the following variables:

   - `name` - The name of the character
   - `health` - The health of the character
   - `attack` - The attack power of the character
   - `defense` - The defense power of the character

   The `Character` class has the following methods:

   - `equipItem()` - Equips an item to the character
   - `fightEnemy()` - Fights an enemy
   - `levelUp()` - Levels up the character

   The `Item` class has the following variables:

   - `name` - The name of the item
   - `type` - The type of the item
   - `effect` - The effect of the item

   The `Item` class has the following methods:

   - `getEffect()` - Returns the effect of the item

   The `Character` class aggregates the `Item` class. This means that a `Character` object can have multiple `Item` objects associated with it. The `Character` class is not responsible for the creation or destruction of the `Item` objects.

   The program uses aggregation to allow the program to equip items to characters. The `Character` class has an `equipItem()` method, which equips an item to the character. The `Item` class has a `getEffect()` method, which returns the effect of the item. The effect of the item is applied to the character when the item is equipped.

   The program is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good understanding of aggregation.

10. **Contact Manager Program**

    This program simulates a contact manager with the following features:

    - Add contacts
    - Edit contacts
    - Delete contacts
    - Search contacts

    The program uses **encapsulation** and **polymorphism** to store and manage contacts. The `Contact` class has the following variables:

    - `name` - The name of the contact
    - `email` - The email address of the contact
    - `phone` - The phone number of the contact

    The `Contact` class has the following methods:

    - `getFullName()` - Returns the full name of the contact
    - `getEmail()` - Returns the email address of the contact
    - `getPhone()` - Returns the phone number of the contact

    The `Contact` class has the following access modifiers:

    - `name` - private
    - `email` - private
    - `phone` - private
    - `getFullName()` - public
    - `getEmail()` - public
    - `getPhone()` - public

    The `name`, `email`, and `phone` variables are private, which means that they can only be accessed by methods in the `Contact` class. This prevents other classes from accessing the data in the `Contact` class directly.

    The `getFullName()`, `getEmail()`, and `getPhone()` methods are public, which means that they can be accessed by other classes. This allows other classes to interact with the `Contact` class in a controlled way.

    The `Contact` class is also polymorphic. This means that it can be used to create different types of contacts, such as `Customer` and `Vendor`. The `Customer` class and the `Vendor` class inherit from the `Contact` class. This allows the program to store and manage contacts of different types in a single list.

    The program uses encapsulation and polymorphism to store and manage contacts in a secure and efficient way.
