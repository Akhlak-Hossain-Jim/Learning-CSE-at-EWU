Read any available documentation or data dictionary to gain insights into the meaning and context of the data.\n","\n","- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess and clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step ensures the data is in a usable format for analysis.\n","\n","- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) to gain a high-level understanding of the data distribution and central tendencies.\n","\n","- **Data Visualization:** Visualize the data using various charts, graphs, and plots to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. Common visualizations include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and line plots.\n","\n","- **Univariate Analysis:** Analyze individual variables in isolation to understand their distributions, skewness, and potential outliers. Use appropriate visualizations and statistical measures for univariate analysis.\n","\n","- **Bivariate Analysis:** Explore relationships between pairs of variables to identify correlations, associations, or dependencies. Scatter plots, heatmaps, correlation matrices, and statistical tests (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient) can be useful for bivariate analysis.\n","\n","- **Multivariate Analysis:** Investigate interactions and dependencies among multiple variables simultaneously. Techniques such as dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), cluster analysis, and parallel coordinates plots can aid in understanding complex relationships.\n","\n","- **Feature Engineering:** Create new derived features or transform existing features to enhance the predictive power of the data. This step may involve techniques like scaling, binning, one-hot encoding, or creating interaction variables.\n","\n","- **Data Quality Check:** Verify the quality of the data by checking for data integrity, consistency, and accuracy. Address any issues or discrepancies that may affect the reliability of the analysis.\n","\n","- **Statistical Testing:** Conduct statistical tests, such as t-tests, chi-square tests, or ANOVA, to evaluate hypotheses, compare groups, or identify significant differences in the data.\n","\n","- **Documentation:** Document your findings, insights, and any decisions made during the EDA process. Prepare clear and concise summaries, visualizations, and reports that effectively communicate the results of your analysis.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"x5mH3McmMxuU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Load dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"8sxU6JfQXkAY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!gdown --id 1Qk5FZxfA_jhDcxI3YmuEIbVgd8ZeldMn"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Gay3yccNXjto","outputId":"f3b944cd-743d-4b7f-c404-1fa10e36050c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731237952455,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":5322,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammad Rifat Ahmmad Rashid","userId":"17207620860184690696"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/gdown/__main__.py:140: FutureWarning: Option `--id` was deprecated in version 4.3.1 and will be removed in 5.0.
