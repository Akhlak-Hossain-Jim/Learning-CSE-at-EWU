# Instructions

This is an individual assignment. Things you need to add in this report:
Project Title: Think of project title for your group. The project title should be the same for each group member.

- What are the types of data? (e.g. Qualitative vs Quantitative; Nominal vs Ordinal; Discrete vs Continuous)
- What is balanced or imbalanced dataset? How does it might affect the performance of a model?
- Write a short description of your task and dataset, such as what are the column in your dataset, their type, what are the range or categories of the values in each column etc.
- Mention if your dataset is balanced or not with quantitative result?
- If any column contains continuous numerical values then calculate the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of that column, otherwise if the values are categorical or discrete then count the frequency and percentage of each type of values.
- Plot bar chart, line graph or pie chat where necessary.
- Create a correlation heat-map with each column.
- How to convert a categorical data to numerical values to get features for machine learning projects?
- Also mention if there are any missing values in any column of not? How do you want to handle those missing values and why?
- Write a conclusion paragraph stating your overall observation.

Remember, you must use python to analyze your dataset. Add the snapshot of the charts. Also add a link to your github repo so that I can check the code (steps) you have followed. Feel free to reach me out in case of any confusion.
