Here’s what comes next based on your lab instructions and previous content:

## What To Do Next

1. **Copy the Code:**  
   Use the PL/SQL code solutions provided above for both Lab 3 and Lab 4. You can copy them directly into your SQL environment for execution.

2. **Run the Code and Test:**  
   - Execute each piece of code (table creation, inserts, procedures, functions, triggers, etc.) in your Oracle SQL database or any compatible PL/SQL environment.
   - For triggers, procedures, and functions, test them with sample data to confirm they work as expected.
   - For procedures/functions with OUT parameters, use anonymous blocks or variable declarations as shown in the examples.

3. **Take Screenshots:**  
   - For every code execution (including output via `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`), take a clear screenshot showing both the code and its result/output.

4. **Compile Documentation:**  
   - Paste each PL/SQL solution and its corresponding screenshot into a Word document under the right lab section (Lab 3 or Lab 4).
   - Use the Markdown content as documentation structure—headings for each question, then your code and then your screenshot.

5. **Export to PDF:**  
   - Once all questions have both code and screenshots, save/export your document as a PDF.
   - Name the PDF as instructed (e.g., `YourStudentID_LAB03.pdf` and `YourStudentID_LAB04.pdf`).

6. **Submit:**  
   - Upload your completed PDFs to the assignment section of your classroom as required by your instructor.
