## _Recursion_

1. Write a program to find GCD of two numbers. You must have to use recursive function to solve this problem.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Sample Input</th><th>Sample Output</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>a. 18, 24</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>b. 13, 23</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody>
</table>

2.  - (a). Suppose, you are given a number n. You have to print n, n-1, n-2,……1 on the console. Write a recursive function to solve the problem.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Sample Input</th><th>Sample Output</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>a. 6</td><td>6 5 4 3 2 1</td></tr></tbody>
</table>

- - (b). Rewrite the previous program to print 1, 2, ……n-2, n-1, n on the console.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Sample Input</th><th>Sample Output</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>a. 7</td><td>1 2 3 4 5 6 7</td></tr></tbody>
</table>

3. Write a program to calculate summation up to n-element of a Fibonacci sequence. You have to calculate the n-th element of the series using recursion.
   - Hint: Fibonacci sequence is 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ……. Every n-th element is the sum of previous two(n-1 and n-2)-th element. Suppose, you want to calculate the sum of first 9 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. First you have to calculate each of the term using a recursive function. Then add the newly calculated term one by one.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Sample Input</th><th>Sample Output</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>a. 8</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody>
</table>

4. Write a program to delete n-th node of a given linked list using recursion.
   ```
    For example, a linked list
        6 2 57 53 18
   ```
   After deleting 3 rd node, the list will be,
   ```
   6 2 53 18
   ```
5. Write a program to sort a linked list using recursion.
   For example, a linked list:
   ```
   61 26 59 31 18
   ```
   After sorting the list,
   ```
   18 26 31 59 61
   ```
